With a decade of experience developing digital applications, platforms, and solutions, Donal has seen and conquered many of the technical challenges presented by the digital transformation. However, increasingly frustrated by incomplete, over complicated and failing projects he sought to understand the role of the social in effecting competitive advantage. A Masters in Science offered a perspective on this very realm. This marriage of the technical and the social provides Donal with a unique viewpoint on what leadership means in a competitive digital environment. This blog shares this view.

*We must understand the complex entanglement of the technical and the social in order to ensure our organisations not only gain competitive advantage, but are also setup to sustain it through a rapidly transforming environment.*
