I've been a software engineer for just over a decade. In that time, there has been a notable upwards trend in wanting an education, and subsequently a career, in 'technogolgy'. Specifically, Science, Technology, Engineering, & Mathematics (STEM). However, something hasn't been quite right in how we've embraced technology & science. The scales have tipped too far towards a mechanical society. Lest we forget, we're humans, not machines.

### To Be, or Not To Be

Ever since I was a spotty, nerdy, and reclusive teenager I have latched onto the technocratic world of technology. The early Internet provided me a safe place to express myself, the screen between be and the world acting as a shield. I made a career out of this that I initially enjoyed. A world where logic seemed to be the rule of thumb, and somewhere I could belong. Everyone says you should find a job that lets you too what you love. I loved coding, being able to create something out of nothing, making the intangible tangible. The trouble is, if I'm being honest, I never enjoyed doing this as a job. It took me a long time to figure out why. See, I always thought what I was doing was logical in nature, following an almost scientific path. However, software development isn't mechanical or clinical in nature, it's an art form. Many organisations treat their software developers like machines to churn out code for boring business use cases that don't have any meaning, they don't solve any problems. If you treat an artist like a machine they aren't going to be happy for very long. 

### An obsession with technology as some sort of objective entity that can solve the world's problems

### Missapropriate software development as a mechanical job, rather than its true form as art

### Blindly believe that tecnology is something anyone can bend to their will
