description: "Executives in many modern organisations often share a vision of fragmented business entities working together in harmony. Each united under the guidance of an imposing, creative, talented leader. The musical metaphor of an orchestra is often used to convey this vision. However, an organisation as an orchestra is destined to stand still."

The notion of the organisation as an orchestra is rolled out at many company outings, town halls, executive meetings, consultants and so on. On the surface, it seems like a good metaphor to use. It offers a picture perfect view of a harmonic organisation full of talented people working towards a common goal. But when we start to look at the realities organisations face in a digital world powered by the knowledge economy, we soon find that using the orchestra as a metaphor is not just incorrect, it's dangerous.

### Following the Sheet Music

In an orchestra, everyone is following predefined sheets of music, and are doing so at the command of the conductor. In an organisation, the conductor is the leader who is responsible for the vision, and for creating the path for subordinates to follow. The sheets of music are the rules, routines, and best practices within the organisation. This  presents a homogenised view of the organisation. One where everything is known before hand and only implementation is required, employees need only follow the plan set out by their leader. However, as the late Hubert Dreyfus argued, this over-reliance on predefined plans and rules counter intuitively leads to less expertise in an organisation. The result? More mistakes. We also know that creativity and innovation comes from diverse backgrounds and the clashes at the boundaries of communities. If, as per the orchestra, we encourage communities to simply stick to what they know and follow what has gone before, our organisations will suffer from path dependency. They will lack the ability to innovate, this means the organisation will not have the dynamic capabilities needed to keep pace with a transforming competitive environment. Rather, we need to encourage employees to make their own music.

### The Language of a Leader

Language is a powerful thing. When it comes from someone in a leadership position, it moulds how people within an organisation shape their goals and routines to achieve the outcome their leader wants them to obtain. This is why it is important we recognise how language and metaphors, such as that of an orchestra, can lead to solidification of engrained outdated modes of operating. We must look to different language in order to break these old moulds, encourage people to take risks, and bring out leadership in everyone. Frank Barrett, a professor at the Navel Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, looks to Jazz as alternative. Jazz offers us a metaphor that highlights, distributed leadership, the importance of safe spaces, experimentation, followership and more. These traits are more important in a fast paced digital world than the rigid, structured, command and control nature of the orchestra.
